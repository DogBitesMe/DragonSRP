DragonSRP
---------
This C++ library implements SRP6a protocol. The library is intended to be portable and modular.
This means you can easily implement your own random generator instead of the OpenSSL included.

Or you can change the way of storing users simply by writing your own class
by inerhiting UserLookup interface.

Or you can change the hash function.

Code can be easily changed to used different mathemathical library instead of OpenSSL BN_functions()
The folder dsrp can be compiled without the -lssl flag.

Note1: Examples are in the app folder.
Note2: This project is currently in development, although the examples are working.
       this means that some things are not yet tested.
Note3: I was lazy to change the name and email first time when creating git repository, so
       there is "draco <draco@allstar.pilsfree.czf>" in git tree which is my hostname.

Thanks for reading.
